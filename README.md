# Rugby World Cup

This project, written in Java, consists of a tournament predictor for the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France. The simulator uses data from World Rugby's world rankings - https://www.world.rugby/tournaments/rankings/mru - as they were on 04/09/23 (the last date before the start of the tournament).
